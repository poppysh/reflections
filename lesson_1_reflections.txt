How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to easily compare the changes in code to pinpoint a fix.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would prevent redundant mistakes and errors and reduce time spent trouble-shooting.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: be able to save at specific milestone intervals and know at what point you can look for errors. Cons: May forget to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To simplify the process and to be able to track changes across files.	

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Log shows all entries with notes to find exact changes. Diff will show line changes between each commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can restore to a point where things are working again.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
